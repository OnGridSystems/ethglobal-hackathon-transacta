# Transacta NFT bridge

Connect your NFTs with ease, [OnGrid](https://ongrid.pro/)'s cross-chain expertise!

## About

It can be challenging to transfer NFTs across zk-EVM Layer-2 networks due to different approaches and/or difference in interfaces. We have taken a step towards eliminating these barriers and removing friction by building a one-stop application for dispatching cross-chain transfers.

Transacta leverages the cross-chain messaging capabilities and bridging solutions currently available to transfer tokens between different networks. It can be considered a bridge aggregator that also offers features specifically designed for NFTs.
